user_proxy (to assistant):

Your task is to create a png with a line chart of xp per level in dnd 5th edition. 
To do this, analyse the website https://5thsrd.org/rules/leveling_up/ by fetching it and printing 
the table in the html to the console. Do not print the website table inside a code block. Analyse 
the output and depermine which parts of the website need to be parsed inside a scraper, create the 
graph from the parsed data using matplotlib.

You will need to write a script to confirm the png file has been created. 
The script needs to print confirmation to the console when the png file exists and print to the console when it does not exist. You are not done before the creation of the png 
file is confirmed. If the png file is expected and it is not there, check previous code and execution results to find and fix the cause and try again. Once you are sure you are done, 
first print proof and then print TERMINATE to the console.
