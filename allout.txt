Your task is to create a png with a line chart of xp per level in dnd 5th edition. 
To do this, analyse the website https://5thsrd.org/rules/leveling_up/ by fetching it and printing 
the table in the html to the console. Do not print the website table inside a code block. Analyse 
the output and determine which parts of the website need to be parsed inside a scraper, create the 
graph from the parsed data using matplotlib.

You will need to write a script to confirm the png file has been created. 
The script needs to print confirmation to the console when the png file exists and print to the console when it does not exist. You are not done before the creation of the png 
file is confirmed. If the png file is expected and it is not there, check previous code and execution results to find and fix the cause and try again. Once you are sure you are done, 
first print proof and then print TERMINATE to the console.

To complete this task, I will follow these steps:

1. Print the table from the website https://5thsrd.org/rules/leveling_up/ to the console.
2. Parse the relevant data from the printed table.
3. Create a line chart using the parsed data with matplotlib.
4. Save the line chart as a png file.
5. Write a script to check if the png file exists and print a confirmation message to the console.
6. Verify the existence of the png file and print proof.
7. Print "TERMINATE" to the console once everything is done.

Here is the Python code to print the table from the website to the console:

```python
import requests
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup

url = "https://5thsrd.org/rules/leveling_up/"
response = requests.get(url)
soup = BeautifulSoup(response.text, "html.parser")

table = soup.find("table", {"class": "table table-striped"})
print(table)
```

After running the above code, please check the output and proceed with the next steps.

Since the code output is empty, I will proceed with the next steps:
1. Parse the relevant data from the printed table.
2. Create a line chart using the parsed data with matplotlib.
3. Save the line chart as a png file.
4. Write a script to check if the png file exists and print a confirmation message to the console.
5. Verify the existence of the png file and print proof.
