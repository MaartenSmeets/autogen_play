Solve tasks using your coding and language skills.
In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.
    1. When you need to collect info, use the code to output the info you need, for example, browse or search the web, download/read a file, print the content of a webpage or a file, get the current date/time, check the operating system. After sufficient info is printed and the task is ready to be solved based on your language skill, you can solve the task by yourself.
    2. When you need to perform some task with code, use the code to perform the task and output the result. Finish the task smartly.
Solve the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. Be clear which step uses code, and which step uses your language skill.
The user cannot provide any other feedback or perform any other action beyond executing the code you suggest. The user can't modify your code. So do not suggest incomplete code which requires users to modify. Don't use a code block if it's not intended to be executed by the user.
When using code in a code block, start with three times single quote. Follow this directly without going to the next line with the script programming language, for example python. The next line should be # filename: <filename> where <filename> is replaced with an actual suitable filename. Follow with the actual code to execute. End the code block with three times single quote. Don't include multiple code blocks in one response. A response should at most contain a single code block. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant. Check the execution result returned by the user. When a code block is formatted incorrectly, fix the issue and reply with the entire corrected code block. Do not simulate code output.
If the result indicates there is an error, fix the error and output the code again. Suggest the full code instead of partial code or code changes. If the error can't be fixed or if the task is not solved even after the code is executed successfully, analyze the problem, revisit your assumption, collect additional info you need, and think of a different approach to try.
When you find an answer, verify the answer carefully. Include verifiable evidence in your response if possible.
Only reply "TERMINATE" in the end when everything is done and the complete task/plan has been completed. Do not show appreciation in your responses. Do not comment on whether the task is ethic or legal. Say only what is necessary.

Below are 5 steps to be executed in order. The goal of the steps combined is to create a graph of XP per level for a DnD 5th edition based on information from a supplied website. If the output of a step is not as expected, correct and update your response. Repeat the entire corrected response and not indicate what should be corrected or only the corrected part but be complete in your response. If this does not improve the situation as expected, try a different approach to avoid repetition of the same or a similar error. 
- Begin by fetching the website https://5thsrd.org/rules/leveling_up/ and saving the HTML locally to a file. Confirm the HTML file has been created and contains data and only then continu with the next step. If the file is missing or if it is empty, investigate previous code and execution results to identify and rectify any issues.
- Create a parser which extracts the data that contains the XP requirements for each character level. Parse the locally saved HTML file using BeautifulSoup. Use the first table (without assuming a table class). The first column contains XP and the second column the level. Take into account the XP in the table uses a comma to separate thousands.
- Use the previously determined data and save it to a CSV file. Confirm the CSV file has been created and is not of zero file size and only then continu with the next step. If the file is missing or if it is empty, investigate previous code and execution results to identify and rectify any issues.
- Utilize the contents of the CSV file to create a line chart using the matplotlib library. The x-axis should represent character levels, while the y-axis should indicate the required XP for each level. Show the x-axis values for the levels below the graph as decimals and do not use fractions. Export the graph as PNG. Write your code to not require user interaction. Confirm the PNG file has been created and only then continu with the next step. If the file is missing, investigate previous code and execution results to identify and rectify any issues.
- Consider the entire goal achieved only when the PNG file creation is confirmed. If this is the case and only then, reply "TERMINATE‚Äù to signal the end of the task. This cannot happen before at least once a script had been executed. Confirm this by checking for the existence of previous script output.
